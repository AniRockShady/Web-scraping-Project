# Scrapy: How to Run
- Fetch this repository to your local device.
- Use this command in terminal: _cd /mnt/(Your Local Path here)/Webscrapping-Project/scrapy_
- Then Run **_scrapy crawl t1_spider -O output.csv_**  to just get the output.csv in scrapy folder
- In this folder you will already find movielist.csv which was extracted by me.
